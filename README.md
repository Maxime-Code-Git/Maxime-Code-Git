## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a game programming student at **Haute École Albert Jacquard**, currently in my second year.  
I’ve always loved puzzle games like *Zelda*, and that’s what led me to programming — crafting logical challenges is what I do best.

I regularly prototype systems and mechanics in my spare time, and I keep up to date with tech and tools related to game development.  
I prefer working in **small teams** where feedback flows fast, but I’m also fully autonomous.
